Terminal 1 > make 
Terminal 1 > ./KM
Terminal 3 > ./NodeB
Terminal 2 > ./NodeA

After running the 3 exes, in NodeA (Terminal 2) you will be asked to enter the encryption mode that you want to use: ECB or CFB. 
Type the wanted one. After that you will be asked what is the path for the file input. Type "plaintext.txt" or use your own file.

That should be it with running the program and testing it. :)
